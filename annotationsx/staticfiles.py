    """
    This subclasses ManifestStaticFilesStorage to make it possible for the static asset manifest
    to have a "mix" of files that have been hashed, and files that have not.

    Example:

    {
        "paths": {
            "AController.js": "AController.73751240244b.js",
            "admin/css/base.css": "admin/css/base.css"
        }
    }

    The problem this solves is when vendor CSS contains url() references to images or other static assets that were
    not included in the build/distribution, and causes the post processor to fail. An example is mirador-combined.css,
    which includes jqueryui as part of the distribution, but refers to image assets that were not included with mirador.
    This issue causes the ManifestStaticFilesStorage post processor to fail.
